Create React application with table that represents a list of cryptocurrency tickers from CoinMarketCap API (https://coinmarketcap.com/api/#endpoint_ticker).

Requirements:
- Application should have pagination which should use browser routing;
- Application should have the opportunity to change sorting and store it in LocalStorage;
- Click on data row should open modal window with full information about selected ticker;
- Data should be updated every minute.

Not required, but could be pros:
- Using TypeScript;
- Using MobX;
- Tests.

You can use anything you want - any libraries, any React versions, anything you like and prefer. And don't think about browser compatibility.

Put your code in GitHub repository and publish demo to GitHub Pages.
